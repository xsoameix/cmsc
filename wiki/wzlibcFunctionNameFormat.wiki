#summary The generic function name format for wzlibc.
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Function Name Format =

All functions exported for third-party use in wzlibc (see wzlibc.h) follow the same general naming format.

*Format*:
{{{
[_]WZLib_[Structure]_[Operation](...);
}}}
 where `[Structure]` is one of the structs defined in wzlibc.h, and `[Operation]` is the specific operation to be performed on the structure.  If a leading underscore `[_]` is present in the function name, then this function is intended only for internal use by wzlibc.

Some Operations appear quite a bit:
||`Init`||Fills the structure with default values (assumes the memory for this structure has already been set to '\0').||
||`Parse`||Reads the structure info from file (if necessary), and makes the structure ready for use.||
||`Free` or `Delete`||Frees any memory held by the structure that cannot be directly `free`'d.||
